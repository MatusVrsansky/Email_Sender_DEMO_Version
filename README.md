Desktop app for sending email to other people.

Requiremenets:

- turn off your Antivirus program (if you have Avast)
- turn on xampp server for communication with phpMyAdmin
- valid registered email and password with the Gmail Account


Bugs:

- password is not hashed in my database table (for more safety I need to fix it)
- would like to provide PDF manual for someone who do not know how to run "local web server".



Sending mails works only through my gmail adress, due to not hashed password I did not registered my personal Gmail account data to the database. 

I would like to finish this app in the near future, still working on it :)
